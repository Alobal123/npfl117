# Deep Learning Seminar, Summer 2017/18

In recent years, **deep neural networks** have been used to solve complex machine-learning problems and have achieved significant **state-of-the-art** results in **many** areas. The whole field of deep learning has been developing **rapidly**, with **new methods** and **techniques** emerging steadily.

The goal of the seminar is to follow the **newest advancements** in the deep learning field. The course takes form of a **reading group** – each lecture a paper is presented by one of the students. The paper is announced in advance, hence all participants can read it beforehand and can take part in the **discussion of the paper**
